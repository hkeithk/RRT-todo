# RRT-todo

Noticed that I was lacking working with Redux/React class components so I wanted to do a simple project to practice React ( class comp. instead of hooks),
Redux and Typescript. 

This helped me familiarize myself with using redux connect, mapState and mapDispatch (and typing them all!!),
since I've always just used useSelector and useDispatch which were much more straightforward..
